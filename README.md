GreenGrid

-----------------------------

This is a website I designed as practice for a fake company. I designed it in Figma then made a SPA static website for it using  HTML/CSS and some JavaScript. 

I wanted to practice making a responsive website that looked good on any screen size. 

The company and all the information/ people on the website are fictional.
